A community driven list of useful OpenMP links. This is not a catalog of all, just a starting point for your explorations. Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python). Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in the [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) list.
